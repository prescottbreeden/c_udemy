C for Beginners Udemy
=====================

Terminology:

- CPU: central processing unit
  does most of the computing work
  instructions are executed here

- RAM: random access memory
  stores the data of a program while it is running

- Hard drive: permanent storage
  stores files that contain program source code even while the computer is
  turned off

- Operating System: 
  developed to help make it more convenient to use computers
  a program that controls the entire operation of a computer
    - all input and output
    - manages the computer's resources and handles the execution of programs
    - Windows, Unix, Android, etc.

- fetch / execute cycle (life of a CPU)
  fetches an instruction from memory (using registers) and executes it (loop)
  a gigahertz CPU can do this about a billion times a second

- Higher level programming languages:
- high-level programming languages make it easier to write programs
  opposite of assembly language
  c is a higher level programming language that describes actions in a more abstract form
  the instructions (statements) of a program look more like problem solving steps
  do not have to worry about the precise steps a particular CPU would have to take to 
    accomplish a particular task
    - total = x + //vs// mv ax, 5, mv cx 4, etc...

- Compilers:
  a program that translates the high-level language source code into the detailed set of 
  machine language instructions the computer requires

  the program does the high-level thinking and the compiler generates the tedious 
  instructions to the CPU

  will check that your program has valid syntax for the programming language that you
  are compiling
    - finds errors and it reports them to you and doesn't produce an executable until 
    you fix them

  high-level languages are easier to learn and much easier to program in than are 
  machine languages

Steps to designing a program:
  1. define the program objectives
  2. design the program
  3. write the code
  4. compile
  5. run the program
  6. test and debug the program
  7. maintain and modify the program
