Control Flow

Statements inside your source files are generally executed form top to bottom, in the order they appear

Control flow statements break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling
your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code

- Decision-making statements
  - if then else
  - switch
  - goto

- Looping statements
  - for
  - while
  - do-while

- branching statements
  - break
  - continue
  - return
